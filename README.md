# Student-Attendance-System

project description
Project name: Student Attendance Management System

project description: This is a software used to manage the attendance status of students in the school, and students can use this software to see teachers, teachers and students can also use this software to query the courses they participate in.

Background of the project
With the advancement of technology and the development of the times, the number of students has increased. The old management record method requires too much manpower and resources. Therefore, the school's management methods also need to keep pace with the times. Effectively manage student attendance information.

Project Objectives
To meet the needs of the school, it can greatly save manpower and material resources and more effectively manage student attendance, course information, I designed and developed the student attendance management system.

Project significance
Greatly reduces the school's resource consumption in attendance management, reduces work pressure, and can manage student attendance information more efficiently and orderly, fundamentally improving the school's information management method, which can handle more and more cumbersome tasks.

Software Requirements


Eclipse MARS.2

Eclipse is a well-known cross-platform free integrated development environment (IDE). Initially mainly used for Java language development, by installing different plug-ins Eclipse can support different computer languages, such as C + + and Python development tools. Eclipse itself is just a framework platform, but the support of many plug-ins makes Eclipse have the flexibility of other IDE software with relatively fixed functions. Many software developers use Eclipse as the framework to develop their own IDE


Tomcat v8.0

Tomcat is a core project in the Jakarta project of the Apache Software Foundation, developed by Apache, Sun, and other companies and individuals. Thanks to Sun's participation and support, the latest Servlet and JSP specifications can always be reflected in Tomcat, and Tomcat 5 supports the latest Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0 specifications. Because Tomcat is advanced in technology, stable in performance, and free, it is loved by Java enthusiasts and has been recognized by some software developers, becoming a popular Web application server.


JSP

JSP (full name JavaServer Pages) is a dynamic web technology standard created by Sun Microsystems. JSP is deployed on the web server, can respond to the request sent by the client, and dynamically generate Web pages of HTML, XML or other format documents according to the content of the request, and then return it to the requester. JSP technology uses Java language as a scripting language to provide services for users' HTTP requests, and can handle complex business requirements together with other Java programs on the server.

MySQL
MySQL is a relational database management system developed by the Swedish MySQL AB company and belongs to Oracle's products. MySQL is one of the most popular relational database management systems. In terms of WEB applications, MySQL is one of the best RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) application software.
MySQL is a relational database management system. Relational databases store data in different tables instead of putting all data in a large warehouse, which increases speed and flexibility.
The SQL language used by MySQL is the most used standardized language for accessing databases. MySQL software adopts a dual-licensing policy, which is divided into a community version and a commercial version. Due to its small size, fast speed, and low total cost of ownership, especially the open-source feature, the development of small and medium-sized websites generally chooses MySQL as the website database.

MD5 encryption
The MD5 algorithm is a type of one-way hashing algorithm. The one-way hash algorithm, also known as HASH, is a function that compresses a message of any length into a fixed-length message (called a message dictionary).
The compression process is irreversible. In the MD5 algorithm, this digest is the mapping of arbitrary data into a 128-bit digest message. It is also irreversible, meaning that the original message cannot be derived from the digest.
The original file cannot be inferred back, and its contents are lost in the computation.
Since the MD5 algorithm ultimately produces 128 bits of data, there are basically 2^128 possibilities, which is a very large amount of data, about 3.4 times 10 to the 38th power.
Although this is an astronomical number, there is basically no limit to the amount of data that can be encrypted, so it is possible to encrypt different content with the MD5 algorithm and get the same digest.
So it is possible for different contents encrypted with MD5 to have the same digits, but the probability is very low. It can be used for digital signatures, message integrity checking, etc.
The MD5 algorithm groups incoming messages into 512-bit groups (64 bytes) and returns a 128-bit result after processing all groups sequentially.
Four rounds of 16 steps are performed for each group of messages, for a total of 64 steps. Each step includes a left shift and at the end of each step the result is shifted by a right shift.
At the end of each step, the result of the calculation is shifted once to the right.
